## Basic Reversed Steam skin
Install it via terminal:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepante/steam-reversed-basic.git && mv "./steam-reversed-basic" ~/.steam/steam/skins/"Basic Reversed"
```

Then in Steam open `Settings` â†’ `Interface`, and select the new skin `Basic Reversed`.  

Tested only on Linux, shouldn't have errors under Windows.
